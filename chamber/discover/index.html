                Located in the southern end of the Misty Mountains, Moria is just the location for being
                close enough to wildlife to enjoy the fresh air of the wilderness whilst being positioned near
                one of the largest dwarven mines of Middle Earth. To the east of Moria, one will run into the 
                Redhorn Pass, the Dimrill Dale, and Lorien where one, if they so desired to entered those sacred forests,
                could visit the wooden elves alongside their queen. To the west of Moria lies the secret pass into the mountain
                and a path leading north to Rivendell for those seaking refuge along a long journey.
                To the northeast of Moria lies your typical highway passes most travelers, unaware of the beauty of Moria,
                will take to cross the mountain. Paths such as the High Pass, Mountain Hall, and Mountain Pass alongside River Gladden
                are also potential roads and places one could visit if in a rush to pass the Misty Mountains.
                Our recommendation, however, is to stop for a spell at Morai where one can enjoy the scenery, the ale, 
                the majest of dwarven mining, and where one might even strike it rich within the deeper quarters of the mines.

                Moria offers a large range of job and professions besides those related to mining, as one might mistakenly expect.
                Surrounding the entrances into the Mines of Moria, one can find numerous land surveying guilds which, upon request, 
                will scout the Misty Mountains for ideal locations for travel, adventuring, and even setting up a home for those wanting to 
                live closer to Moria. One will also find transportation services speeding the journey from Moria to other well known locations,
                such as Lorien, Rivendell, and even further beyond. Once inside the glories mines, there are, of course, mining parties
                which seek claims to various depths of the mines looking particularly for precious materials, such as mithril. On the higher levels of the mine,
                one can find blacksmiths, carpenters, traders, various locations for feasting, engineers of all types, and above all, our world renowned
                architectural and stone artists. Those seeking a future trade in stone working would be wise to consider coming to Moria.

                Residents of Moria enjoy a very comfortable lifestyle with all of the accessible facilities Moria has to offer.
                Boasting a generally high income rate for most locals in the dwarven capital, there is practically no lower class to be found
                in the halls of Moria. Our ever expanding mines allow for housing within the safety of the mountain, and an inner
                railway system insures fast transporation from the main trading and banquet halls straight to the work place.
                Even without the walls of the mountain, Moria stands as a marvel of a trading point which sees hundreds of travelers passing
                by each day, allowing for a wide variety of imports. 80% of visitors to Moria left an "excellent" review, indicated that they would 
                gladly pass and stay in the Mines of Moria on their next visit. The other 20% found their visit pleasant and wished they had made
                more time to better enjoy Moria and the surrounding landscape.

                As mentioned, housing and real estate is continually increasing above and below the Mines of Moria. 
                Current residents find comfort, safety, and easy commute from the carved homes and mansions found under the Misty Mountain.
                Near to trading markets and the entertainment of the Halls of Moria, living inside the Misty Mountain is becoming a popular choice with newer
                residents. If you find the torch-lit grandeur of mines too stifling for you, then fear not! Multiple dwarven owned
                real estate companies have decided to collaborate with nearby rangers and elves to provide you expanded real estate options
                which span the entire range of the Misty Mountains. Contact any real estate agency within the Halls of Moria to find
                out which real estate guild is best for you. Most residents who have chosen to build their own homes exposed to the fresh air of the mountains
                have found that water, food, and the scenery is second to none!
